A data engineer is a person who is responsible for designing and maintaining data pipelines, data storage systems, and data processing systems. These tasks include data modelling, warehousing, integration, quality management, and security. They also ensure that the data pipelines are efficient and scalable and can handle the volume, velocity and variety of data that the organization is dealing with to ensure that the data is accessible, accurate, and useful for analysis.

With the advent of cloud computing, the amount of data generated every moment reached an unprecedented scale. The discipline of data science flourishes in this environment, deriving knowledge and insights from massive amounts of data. As data science becomes critical to business, its processes must be treated with the same rigor as other components of business IT. For example, software engineering teams today embrace DevOps to develop and operate services with 99.99999% availability guarantees. Data engineering brings a similar rigor to data science, so data-centric processes run reliably, smoothly, and in a compliant way.

The goal of data engineering is to make large and complex data accessible for others to interpret. When data — both structured and unstructured — enters a company’s systems, data engineers are the first people to get their hands on it. Data engineering also sees to the creation of data management systems and infrastructure that allows data scientists and analysts to access, process and analyze data with ease. This includes building data lakes, warehouses, and marts and creating data access and retrieval systems. It is a very important component of the data life cycle which enables organizations to effectively collect, manage and use large volumes of data. Data engineering is where software engineering, cloud and DevOps meet.

The Data Engineering Ecosystem includes several different components. It includes disparate data types, formats, and sources of data. Data Pipelines gather data from multiple sources, transform it into analytics-ready data, and make it available to data consumers for analytics and decision-making. Data repositories, such as relational and non-relational databases, data warehouses, data marts, data lakes, and big data stores process and store this data. Data Integration Platforms combine disparate data into a unified view for the data consumers. You will learn about each of these components. You will also learn about Big Data and the use of some of the Big Data processing tools.

## How It Works?

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/213917819-7afbfc9c-b35b-4459-a86c-c28c09f4a429.svg)

A typical Data Engineering lifecycle includes architecting data platforms, designing data stores, and gathering, importing, wrangling, querying, and analyzing data. It also includes performance monitoring and finetuning to ensure systems are performing at optimal levels.

Let's expand it and analyze the complete ecosystem from a wider perspective:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/213917792-c61931fb-c440-4ea3-b133-edf8bfbc40e0.gif)

The first type of data engineering is SQL-focused. The work and primary storage of the data is in relational databases. All of the data processing is done with SQL or a SQL-based language. Sometimes, this data processing is done with an ETL tool. The second type of data engineering is Big Data–focused. The work and primary storage of the data is in Big Data technologies like Hadoop, Cassandra, and HBase. All of the data processing is done in Big Data frameworks like MapReduce, Spark, and Flink. While SQL is used, the primary processing is done with programming languages like Java, Scala, and Python.

Data engineering is the part of data science that deals with the practical applications of collecting and analyzing data. It aims to bring engineering rigor to the process of building and supporting reliable data systems.

The ML part of data science deals with building a model. In the Netflix scenario, the data model recommends, based on your viewing history, which movies you are likely to enjoy next. The data engineering part of the discipline deals with building a system that continuously gathers and cleans up the viewing history, then runs the model at scale on the data of all users and distributes the results to the recommendation user interface. All of this provided in an automated fashion with monitoring and alerting build around each step of the process.

Data engineering deals with building and operating big data platforms to support all data science scenarios. There are various other terms used for some of these aspects: DataOps refers to moving data in a data system, MLOps refers to running ML at scale as in our Netflix example. (ML combined with DevOps is also known as MLOps.) Our definition of data engineering encompasses all of these and looks at how we can implement DevOps for data science.

## Why Is It Important?

Data engineers are in the business of moving data—either getting it from one location to another or transforming the data in some man‐ ner. It is these hard workers who provide the digital grease that makes a data project a reality.

Internet companies create a lot of data. Datasets are getting larger and messier in he internet era where there are large datasets for all the actions and interactions users make with your website all the way to product descriptions, images, time series info, comments etc.

It is said that data is the new oil. For natural oil, we also need a way to drill and mine this oil for it to be useful. In the same way, we need a way to mine and make sense of all this data to be useful. On one had, there is a desire by executives and management to get insights from these datasets. There is also a desire by data scientists and ML practitioners to have clean datasets to model with.

There are some really interesting trade-offs to make when you do this. And knowing about these can help you in your own journey as a data scientist or ML person working with large data. Irrespective of where you are in your data journey, I think you will find these interesting.

## Key Concepts

1. Data Warehousing: The process of collecting, storing, and managing large sets of data in a central repository for reporting and analysis. Data warehousing allows organizations to store and access large amounts of data in a structured and efficient manner. This enables users to easily query and extract insights from the data, and it also supports the creation of data-driven reports and dashboards.
2. Data Modeling: The process of designing and creating a conceptual representation of data and its relationships, typically using diagrams or other tools. Data modeling is an important step in the data warehousing process, as it helps to ensure that data is stored in a logical and consistent manner. This makes it easier for users to understand and navigate the data, and it also supports the creation of efficient data queries.
3. Data Integration: The process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Data integration is a critical step in the data warehousing process, as it allows organizations to combine data from different systems and sources into a single repository. This enables users to access and analyze data from multiple sources in a single location, and it also supports the creation of data-driven reports and dashboards.
4. Data Pipelines: The process of creating a series of steps to automatically extract, transform, and load data from one system to another. Data pipelines are an essential component of data warehousing and integration, as they automate the process of moving data from one system to another. This reduces the need for manual data entry and improves the accuracy and efficiency of data processing.
5. Data Quality: The process of ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and relevant, and that it meets the needs of the users and systems that rely on it. Data quality is a critical consideration for data engineers, as it helps to ensure that data is usable and valuable for decision making. This includes tasks such as data validation, data cleaning, and data standardization.
6. Data Governance: The process of creating policies and procedures to manage data throughout its lifecycle, including data security and compliance. Data governance is an important consideration for data engineers, as it helps to ensure that data is used and stored in a secure and compliant manner. This includes tasks such as data security, data privacy, and data compliance.
7. Data Processing: The process of applying algorithms and other methods to extract insights and value from data. Data processing is a critical step in the data warehousing process, as it allows organizations to extract insights and value from their data. This includes tasks such as data analysis, data mining, and machine learning.
8. Data Visualization: The process of creating graphical representations of data to help users understand and explore the data. Data visualization is an important step in the data warehousing process, as it allows users to easily explore and understand their data. This includes creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations that make it easy to see patterns and trends in the data.

## Big Data

![Six Vs of big data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/213918079-10af46d9-f906-4c3e-9b84-ddc47708bd15.png)

### Big Data Architectures

#### Lambda

Lambda architecture comprises Batch Layer, Speed Layer (also known as Stream layer), and Serving Layer.

The batch layer operates on the complete data and thus allows the system to produce the most accurate results. However, the results come at the cost of high latency due to high computation time. The batch layer stores the raw data as it arrives and computes the batch views for consumption. Naturally, batch processes will occur at some interval and will be long-lived. The scope of data is anywhere from hours to years.

The speed layer generates results in a low-latency, near real-time fashion. The speed layer is used to compute the real-time views to complement the batch views. The speed layer receives the arriving data and performs incremental updates to the batch layer results. Thanks to the incremental algorithms implemented at the speed layer, the computation cost is significantly reduced.

The batch views may be processed with more complex or expensive rules and may have better data quality and less skew, while the real-time views give you up-to-the-moment access to the latest possible data.

Finally, the serving layer enables various queries of the results sent from the batch and speed layers. The outputs from the batch layer in the form of batch views and the speed layer in the form of near-real-time views are forwarded to the serving layer, which uses this data to cater to the pending queries on an ad-hoc basis.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/213918086-32e76d06-a398-40ad-9271-16b9ffc3bb6b.png)

**Pros**

- It is a good balance of speed, reliability, and scalability. The batch layer of Lambda architecture manages historical data with the fault-tolerant, distributed storage, ensuring a low possibility of errors even if the system crashes.
- Access to both real-time and offline results in covering many data analysis scenarios very well.
- Having access to a complete data set in a batch window may yield specific optimizations that make Lambda better performing and perhaps even simpler to implement.

**Cons**

- Although the offline layer and the real-time stream face different scenarios, their internal processing logic is the same, so there are many duplicate modules and coding overhead.
- Reprocesses every batch cycle, which is not beneficial in specific scenarios.
- A data set modeled with Lambda architecture is difficult to migrate or reorganize.

**Use Cases**

- User queries are required to be served on an ad-hoc basis using immutable data storage.
- Quick responses are required, and the system should handle various updates in new data streams.
- None of the stored records shall be erased, and it should allow the addition of updates and new data to the database.

#### Kappa

The Kappa architecture solves the redundant part of the Lambda architecture. It is designed with the idea of replaying data. Kappa architecture avoids maintaining two different code bases for the batch and speed layers. The key idea is to handle real-time data processing, and continuous data reprocessing using a single stream processing engine and avoid a multi-layered Lambda architecture while meeting the standard quality of service.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62965911/213918082-56da8775-caee-4db4-b515-7c20ee2bc6bd.png)

**Pros**

- Applications can read and write directly to Kafka (or other message queue) as developed. For existing event sources, listeners are used to stream writes directly from database logs (or datastore equivalents), eliminating the need for batch processing during ingress, resulting in fewer resources.
- Treating every data point in your organization as a streaming event also provides you the ability to 'time travel' to any point and see the state of all data in your organization.
- Queries only need to look in a single serving location instead of going against batch and speed views.

**Cons**

- The complication of this architecture mainly revolves around having to process this data in a stream, such as handling duplicate events, cross-referencing events, or maintaining order - operations that are generally easier to do in batch processing.
- Although the Kappa architecture looks concise, it isn't easy to implement, especially for the data replay.
- For Lambda, catalog services can auto-discover and document file and database systems. Kafka doesn't align with this tooling, so supporting scaling to enterprise-sized environments strongly infers implementing confluent enterprise with a schema registry that attempts to play the role of a catalog service.

**Use Cases**

- When the algorithms applied to the real-time data and the historical data are identical, it is very beneficial to use the same code base to process historical and real-time data and, therefore, implement the use-case using the Kappa architecture.
- Kappa architecture can be used to develop data systems that are online learners and therefore don't need the batch layer.
- The order of the events and queries is not predetermined. Stream processing platforms can interact with the database at any time.

Kappa is not a replacement for Lambda as some use-cases deployed using the Lambda architecture cannot be migrated.

When you seek an architecture that is more reliable in updating the data lake as well as efficient in training the machine learning models to predict upcoming events robustly, then use the Lambda architecture as it reaps the benefits of both the batch layer and speed layer to ensure few errors and speed.

On the other hand, when you want to deploy big data architecture using less expensive hardware and require it to deal effectively with unique events occurring continuously, then select the Kappa architecture for your real-time data processing needs.

2. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into groups (strata) and selecting a sample from each group. This can be useful when the data is not uniformly distributed and you want to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire dataset.
3. Cluster sampling: Cluster sampling involves dividing the data into clusters and selecting a sample of clusters for analysis. This can be useful when it is impractical or costly to analyze the entire dataset.
4. Systematic sampling: Systematic sampling involves selecting data at fixed intervals from the larger dataset. This can be useful when the data is ordered in some way, such as by time or location.

Data sampling can be an effective way to reduce the size of a dataset and speed up analysis, but it is important to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire dataset to avoid biases or errors in the analysis.

#### 44. How do you handle data sampling challenges in your data pipelines and data models?

Data sampling is the process of selecting a representative subset of data from a larger dataset for the purpose of analysis. Data sampling can be useful when working with very large datasets, as it can allow you to work with a smaller and more manageable data set while still gaining useful insights. However, there are several challenges that can arise when sampling data in a data pipeline or model, and different approaches can be taken to address these challenges. Some common challenges and potential solutions include:

1. Representative sampling: To get meaningful and accurate results from your data sample, it is important to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population of data. This can be challenging, especially if the data is not uniformly distributed or if there are biases in the sampling process. To address this challenge, you may need to use a sampling method that is appropriate for your data and ensure that the sample is selected randomly and without bias.
2. Sample size: The size of the sample can have a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained from the data. If the sample is too small, the results may not be representative of the population, while if the sample is too large, it may be unnecessarily time-consuming and resource-intensive to process. To address this challenge, you may need to carefully consider the appropriate sample size for your data and analysis needs.
3. Sampling error: Even with a representative sample, there is always a chance that the results obtained from the sample will differ from the results that would be obtained from the entire population of data. This is known as sampling error. To minimize sampling error, you may need to use a larger sample size or use a sampling method that is less prone to error.
4. Data quality: The quality of the data in the sample can also impact the accuracy and reliability of the results. To address this challenge, you may need to perform data cleansing and data quality checks on the sample to identify and correct any issues with the data.
5. Data security: When sampling data, it is important to ensure that the data is secure and protected from unauthorized access or tampering. You may need to implement security measures such as encryption, authentication, and access control to protect the data as it is being sampled.

#### 45. What is data masking?

Data masking is the process of obscuring or altering sensitive or personal data in order to protect it from unauthorized access or use. It is often used to protect data when it is being shared or used for testing or development purposes.

There are several methods that can be used to mask data, including:

1. Replacement: This involves replacing sensitive data with fictitious or generic data, such as replacing a customer's name with "John Doe" or replacing a credit card number with a random number.
2. Encryption: This involves converting sensitive data into a coded format that can only be accessed with a decryption key.
3. Tokenization: This involves replacing sensitive data with a unique identifier or token, which can be used to retrieve the original data if needed.
4. Redaction: This involves completely removing sensitive data from a document or data set.

Data masking is an important aspect of data privacy and security, as it helps to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or use. It is important to carefully plan and implement data masking processes in order to ensure that the data is effectively protected.

#### 46. How do you handle data masking challenges in your data pipelines and data models?

Data masking is the process of obscuring sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) in a dataset by replacing it with fake or dummy data. Data masking can be useful for protecting the privacy of individuals and complying with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. However, there are several challenges that can arise when masking data in a data pipeline or model, and different approaches can be taken to address these challenges. Some common challenges and potential solutions include:

1. Data quality: Data masking can sometimes impact the quality or integrity of the data, especially if the masking process introduces errors or inconsistencies into the data. To address this challenge, you may need to carefully design and test the data masking process to ensure that the masked data is still accurate and useful.
2. Data security: Data masking should not compromise the security of the data, and the masked data should still be protected from unauthorized access or tampering. To address this challenge, you may need to implement appropriate security measures such as encryption, authentication, and access control to protect the masked data.
3. Data governance: When masking data, it is important to ensure that the process is consistent and compliant with any relevant data protection regulations or policies. To address this challenge, you may need to implement robust data governance processes and controls to manage the masking process and ensure that it is performed correctly.
4. Performance: Data masking can be a resource-intensive process, especially if the data being masked is very large. To address this challenge, you may need to optimize the data masking process or consider using more powerful hardware or software to speed up the process.
5. Scalability: As your data grows over time, your data masking process may need to scale up to handle the increased volume and complexity of the data. You may need to consider using more powerful hardware or software, or implementing a more scalable data architecture, to ensure that your data masking process can keep up with the demands of your business.

#### 47. What is data anonymization?

Data anonymization is the process of removing personally identifiable information (PII) from data. The goal of data anonymization is to protect the privacy of individuals by making it difficult or impossible to identify them from the data.

There are several techniques for anonymizing data:

1. Pseudonymization: Pseudonymization involves replacing PII with artificial identifiers, such as randomly generated numbers or codes. This can make it difficult to link the data back to an individual, but it is not a complete anonymization solution, as the artificial identifiers may still be used to re-identify individuals.
2. Aggregation: Aggregation involves combining data from multiple records or sources and calculating statistical summaries, such as averages or totals. This can help protect the privacy of individuals by making it difficult to identify them from the data.
3. K-anonymity: K-anonymity involves ensuring that there are at least k records in the dataset that have the same values for the sensitive attributes, making it difficult to identify a specific individual from the data.
4. Differential privacy: Differential privacy is a mathematical concept that involves adding noise to the data to obscure sensitive information. This can help protect the privacy of individuals while still allowing for meaningful analysis of the data.

Data anonymization is an important consideration when working with sensitive data, as it helps protect the privacy of individuals and comply with data protection regulations.

#### 48. How do you handle data anonymization challenges in your data pipelines and data models?

Data anonymization is the process of removing or obscuring personal or identifying information from data sets in order to protect the privacy of individuals. It is often used when data is being shared or used for research or testing purposes.

There are several challenges that can arise during the data anonymization process in data pipelines and data models:

1. Identifying personal data: One challenge is identifying which data elements contain personal or identifying information. This can be particularly challenging if the data set is large or complex.
2. Ensuring that data is truly anonymous: Another challenge is ensuring that the data is truly anonymous and cannot be re-identified. This may require more advanced techniques, such as aggregation or perturbation, to effectively obscure the data.
3. Maintaining data quality: Data anonymization can impact the quality of the data, particularly if important data elements are removed or obscured. It is important to carefully consider the impact of anonymization on the data set and take steps to ensure that the data remains of high quality.
4. Complying with data privacy laws and regulations: It is important to ensure that data anonymization is conducted in a way that complies with relevant data privacy laws and regulations. This may involve obtaining consent from individuals or implementing measures to protect sensitive data.

To address these challenges, it may be necessary to use a combination of techniques, such as data masking and data aggregation, as well as to establish processes and policies for data anonymization that ensure compliance with data privacy laws and regulations.

#### 49. What is data lineage?

Data lineage is the process of tracing the origin and evolution of data as it moves through various systems and transformations. It is often used to understand how data is transformed and used throughout an organization, and to identify any potential errors or inconsistencies in the data.

Data lineage can be traced manually or through the use of specialized software tools that automate the process. These tools often provide visualizations of the data flow and transformation process, making it easier to understand and analyze the data lineage.

Data lineage is important for a number of reasons. It can help organizations to improve the quality and accuracy of their data by identifying and addressing any issues with data integrity. It can also help organizations to comply with regulatory requirements, as many regulations require organizations to maintain accurate and complete records of their data processing activities. In addition, data lineage can be used to optimize data flow and improve the efficiency of data-driven processes.

#### 50. How do you handle data lineage challenges in your data pipelines and data models?

Data lineage refers to the history of data as it moves through a system, including how it is transformed and used. It is an important aspect of data management because it helps organizations understand the provenance of their data and how it has been used, which can be useful for tasks such as debugging, compliance, and data governance.

There are several ways to handle data lineage challenges in data pipelines and data models:

1. Documenting data lineage: One way to handle data lineage challenges is to document the lineage of data as it moves through the pipeline. This can be done using tools such as data dictionaries, documentation, and metadata tags.
2. Automating data lineage tracking: Another way to handle data lineage challenges is to use tools that automatically track the lineage of data as it moves through the pipeline. These tools can help organizations understand how data has been transformed and used, and can be useful for tasks such as debugging and compliance.
3. Using data governance frameworks: Organizations can also use data governance frameworks to help manage data lineage. These frameworks can help organizations establish policies and procedures for managing data, including how it is used and shared.
4. Implementing data quality checks: Ensuring that data is accurate and consistent is an important aspect of data lineage. Organizations can implement data quality checks at various points in the pipeline to ensure that the data being used is of high quality.
5. Using data modeling techniques: Data modeling techniques, such as entity-relationship modeling, can be used to help understand the relationships between different data elements and how they are transformed as they move through the pipeline.
