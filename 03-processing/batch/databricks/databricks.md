# Databricks

> Databricks is a platform that enables enterprises to quickly build their Data Lakehouse infrastructure and enable all data personas – data engineers, data scientists, and business intelligence personnel – in their organization to extract and deliver insights from the data. The platform provides a curated experience for each data persona, enabling them to execute their daily workflows. The foundational technologies that enable these experiences are open source – Apache Spark, Delta lake, MLflow, and more.

Databricks was founded in 2013 by seven researchers at the University of California, Berkeley.

This was the time when the world was learning how the **Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Apple** (**MANGA**) companies had built their success by scaling up their use of AI techniques in all aspects of their operations. Of course, they could do this because they invested heavily in talent and infrastructure to build their data and AI systems. Databricks was founded with the mission to enable everyone else to do the same – use data and AI in service of their business, irrespective of their size, scale, or technological prowess.

The mission was to democratize AI. What started as a simple platform, leveraging the open source technologies that the co-founders of Databricks had created, has now evolved into the lakehouse platform, which unifies data, analytics, and AI in one place.

Databricks was born out of the frustration of the Hadoop vendors and two Apache projects: Hadoop and Spark. Databricks is the commercial entity of Apache Spark. Apache Spark was born out of frustration with Apache Hadoop and the commercial vendors where only one is left: Cloudera. Hadoop does not do well with concurrency and it has huge latency issues. Apache MapReduce is dead and was replaced with Apache Spark to remedy these limitations. Apache Spark has problems of its own and thus Databricks was born to take Spark to Enterprise.
